# Spring Boot Examples
The Spring Boot Examples repository is dedicated to unit testing Java code. This project emphasizes the importance of robust unit testing practices within a Spring framework environment. Here, we focus solely on the unit testing aspect of the application.

## Overview
The Spring Boot Examples demonstrates the significance of thorough unit testing in Java projects, particularly within the Spring framework. By prioritizing unit tests, this project aims to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionalities.

## Development Process
The development process of the Spring Boot integrates cutting-edge AI-powered tools, notably RoostGPT, alongside established practices:

#### 1. Implementation:
Java code is implemented following Spring framework conventions, with an emphasis on RESTful APIs and designs.

#### 2. Test Generation with RoostGPT:
RoostGPT is utilized to generate API tests based on API specification files. This innovative approach enhances test coverage and efficiency in the development process.

#### 3. Test Execution: 
Maven is used as the build automation tool to compile the code and execute both manually crafted and AI-generated unit tests. This ensures thorough validation of the application's functionality.

## Running Maven Tests
To run Maven tests for the Spring Boot Examples project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/roost-io/spring-boot-examples.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd spring-boot-examples
   ```

3. **Run the unit tests:**

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

   This command executes all unit tests defined within the project, providing feedback on test results and code coverage.

4. **(Optional) Run Specific Tests:**  
   If you want to run specific test classes or methods, you can use Maven's Surefire plugin to filter tests. Use the following command format:

   - To run a specific test class:

     ```bash
     mvn -Dtest=TestClassName test
     ```

     Replace `TestClassName` with the name of the class containing the tests you want to run.

   - To run a specific test method within a class:

     ```bash
     mvn -Dtest=TestClassName#testMethodName test
     ```

     Replace `testMethodName` with the name of the test method you want to run.
