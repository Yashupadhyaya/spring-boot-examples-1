ROOST_METHOD_HASH=deleteUserById_d2e10e3468
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteUserById_4428a24bd8

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The function deleteUserById(Long id) is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This can occur if the 'id' parameter value is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query structure.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate this vulnerability. These techniques can ensure that user-supplied input is always treated as literal data within the query, rather than part of the query itself.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The deleteUserById(Long id) function does not implement any authorization checks, meaning any user could potentially delete users if they can provide a valid 'id'. This could lead to unauthorized data modification or deletion.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that the current user has sufficient privileges to perform the delete operation.

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improper Error Handling
Issue: The deleteUserById(Long id) function does not appear to handle any potential errors that might occur during the deletion process. This could potentially expose sensitive information in error messages, or lead to inconsistent system state if errors are not properly addressed.
Solution: Implement proper error handling and logging. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages, and ensure that the system can recover or maintain a consistent state in case of errors.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid User Deletion
  Details: 
    TestName: testValidUserDeletion
    Description: This test checks the functionality of deleting a user by providing a valid id. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create and save a UserEntity with a specific id in the database.
    Act: Call the deleteUserById method with the id of the created UserEntity.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the UserEntity with the specified id no longer exists in the database.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the method can successfully delete a user when provided with a valid id. It's crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application's data.

Scenario 2: Deletion of Non-existent User
  Details: 
    TestName: testNonExistentUserDeletion
    Description: This test checks how the method behaves when attempting to delete a user that doesn't exist in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure the database does not contain a UserEntity with a specific id.
    Act: Call the deleteUserById method with the id that doesn't exist in the database.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions were thrown during execution.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the method can handle attempts to delete non-existent users gracefully. It's important for preventing unexpected errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Deletion with Null Id
  Details: 
    TestName: testDeletionWithNullId
    Description: This test checks how the method behaves when provided with a null id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement needed as we're providing null.
    Act: Call the deleteUserById method with null as the id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that an exception was thrown during execution.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the method correctly handles a null id, which is an invalid input. It's crucial for maintaining the robustness of the application.

Scenario 4: Deletion of User with Multiple Entries
  Details: 
    TestName: testUserWithMultipleEntriesDeletion
    Description: This test checks if the method can handle deleting a user with multiple entries in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create and save multiple UserEntity instances with the same id in the database.
    Act: Call the deleteUserById method with the shared id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no UserEntities with the specified id exist in the database.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the method can handle the deletion of multiple entries. It's important for ensuring data consistency in the application.
