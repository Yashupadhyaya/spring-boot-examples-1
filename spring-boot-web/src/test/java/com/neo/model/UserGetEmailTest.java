================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Public getter method for seemingly private data (email) effectively defeats intended access control. This may reveal sensitive information unintentionally.
Solution: Reassess access modifiers for your methods and data. If exposing the 'email' data is required, consider introducing methods to manage its access securely, such as using a secure token instead of the actual sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-907: Incomplete Cleanup
Issue: Unused import 'jakarta.persistence.*' might contribute to unnecessary use of resources and could potentially introduce unexpected vulnerabilities along with it.
Solution: Consider removing unused libraries and imports to clean up the code and minimize potential attack surface.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Email Retrieval Test

Details:  
    TestName: retrieveValidEmail.
    Description: This test is meant to check the retrieval of a valid email stored in the 'email' field.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: A previously stored email in the 'email' field.
    Act: Invoke the getEmail() method.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned email matches the expected email.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getEmail() method correctly retrieves the stored email. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the getEmail() method.

Scenario 2: Empty String Email Test

Details:  
    TestName: retrieveEmptyEmail.
    Description: The test is designed to check the scenario when the 'email' field is set to an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An empty string in the 'email' field.
    Act: Call the getEmail() method.
    Assert: Ensure that an empty string is returned.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is aimed to validate that the getEmail() method can handle the scenario of an empty email, returning an empty string instead of null or throwing an exception.

Scenario 3: Null Email Test

Details:  
    TestName: retrieveNullEmail.
    Description: This test is intended to check the getEmail() method when the 'email' field is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the 'email' field to null.
    Act: Call the getEmail() method.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    This test validates the getEmail() method's ability to handle null values. This is significant in the scenario where the 'email' field might not have been initialized, and it helps ensure the method won't throw null pointer exceptions. 

Scenario 4: Special Characters Email Test

Details:  
    TestName: retrieveEmailWithSpecialCharacters.
    Description: The test checks the getEmail() method when the 'email' field contains special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the 'email' field to a string with special characters.
    Act: Call the getEmail() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned email accurately reflects the special characters.
  Validation: 
    This test checks the getEmail() method's capability to handle email addresses with special characters. It's important as it verifies the method's support for a variety of legitimate email formats.
