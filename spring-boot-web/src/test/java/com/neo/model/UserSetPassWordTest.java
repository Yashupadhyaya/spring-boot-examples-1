================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: The password is being set potentially using a setter function 'setPassWord()'. If this is being passed in clear text or from untrusted sources, it could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized access through it.
Solution: Use hashed password instead of clear text, and retrieve user inputs from trusted sources only. Consider applying encryption when transmitting sensitive info.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The 'setPassWord()' method lacks input validation and can be used without any restriction. This could be a leftover debug code, which could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized access.
Solution: Remove debug code in production and apply principle of least privilege. Validate user inputs before using them.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: There is no try-catch block around the 'setPassWord()' method. If it fails, Java may declare a stack trace that might expose sensitive data.
Solution: Wrap the method inside a try-catch block and handle potential errors safely without exposing sensitive information.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check normal functionality of setting password.

  Details:  
    TestName: setPasswordValidCase
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct functionality when setting a valid password.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: We set a valid password string as input. 
    Act: Invoke the setPassWord function with this valid password.
    Assert: No assertion needed since this function doesn't return or change anything observable outside the function. 
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the method can normally function given a valid password string, and doesn't throw an error.

    
  Scenario 2: Test to check the response of the function without input.

  Details:  
    TestName: setPasswordWithoutInput
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a case where no password string is provided.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: We set an empty string as input. 
    Act: Invoke the setPassWord function with this empty string.
    Assert:  Again, no assertion since this function doesn't return or change anything observable outside the function. However, internally the method should not set the password field to null or empty. 
  Validation: 
    This test checks if the method gracefully handles the scenario of not provided any password, without throwing an exception.


  Scenario 3: Test to check the response of the function for null input

  Details:  
    TestName: setPasswordNullInput
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a case where a null input is provided as password.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We set null as an input.
    Act: Invoke the setPassWord function with null as input.
    Assert: No assertion needed since this function doesn't return or change anything observable outside the function.
  Validation: 
    This test checks how the method handles null password input, and whether it throws a null pointer exception or handles it graciously.


  Scenario 4: Test to check the response of the function for massive string input 

  Details:  
    TestName: setPasswordMassiveInput
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles massive password input, or whether it has any limits on input size.
  Execution:
    Arrange: We set a massive string as the password input.
    Act: Invoke the setPassWord function with this massive string as input.
    Assert: No assertion needed since this function doesn't return or change anything observable outside the function.
  Validation: 
    This test checks how the method handles massive inputs, and whether it maintains performance consistency, or throws an out of memory exception.
