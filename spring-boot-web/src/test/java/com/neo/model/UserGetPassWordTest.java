================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR, CWE-639)
Issue: The 'getPassword' method directly exposes the password attribute of the class. This may lead to data leakage if the method is mistakenly used on public routes or mistakenly logged.
Solution: It's advisable not to expose getter methods for sensitive attributes, specially the password attribute. Passwords should be handled and stored securely, preferably hashed, and never returned to the client. Consider removing this method.

"""
 Scenario 1: Test to Validate Password Return Value
  
  Details:
    TestName: testGetPasswordReturnValue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPassWord method is returning the correct password from the instance. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock object with a known password value.
    Act: Use the getPassWord method on the mock object to retrieve the password.
    Assert: Check if the returned password matches with the known password.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies whether the getPassWord method is retrieving the correct password value. It evaluates the functionality of the getPassWord method to ensure that it returns the correct password when called. 

 Scenario 2: Test to Validate Null as Password Return Value
  
  Details:
    TestName: testGetPasswordReturnNull
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getPassWord method returns null when the password in the instance is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock object without setting a password.
    Act: Invoke the getPassWord method on the mock object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned password is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the getPassWord method can handle instances where the password is not set, by returning null. The test is integral as it ensures that the method doesn't fail but handles and returns null when no password is set.

 Scenario 3: Test to Validate Non-String Password Return Value

  Details:
    TestName: testGetPasswordReturnNonString
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPassWord method only returns a string type.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock object where the password is set to a non-string value.
    Act: Invoke the getPassWord method on the mock object.
    Assert: Check if a ClassCastException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getPassWord method can only return a String type. The significance of this test lies in the validation of the correct handling of the method in the event of an error.
