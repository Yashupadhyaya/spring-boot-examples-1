================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The getter method is public and without any access control. This may expose sensitive information depending on what the `nickName` string represents in your application context.
Solution: Implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. This could include appropriate access modifiers based on the principle of least privilege, or robust user authentication and authorization controls for API endpoints that utilize this getter method.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the `nickName` variable includes private or personally identifiable information (PII), the public exposure of these getter methods can lead to a privacy violation.
Solution: Use encryption methods for sensitive strings, place strict access restrictions, or avoid storing PII, whenever possible, to prevent privacy violations.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check for a valid Nickname
Details: 
  TestName: testValidNickname.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getNickName method returns the correct expected nickname.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required because getNickName does not require inputs.
  Act: Invoke getNickName method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the actual result against the expected nickname.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the getNickName method functions as expected by properly returning the nickname. Any deviation from the expected nickname indicates a possible issue within the method.

Scenario 2: Check for Non Null Nickname
Details: 
  TestName: testNonNullNickname.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getNickName method returns a non-null output.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangements are needed since getNickName requires no inputs.
  Act: Call getNickName method.
  Assert: Use assertNotNull to verify that the actual result isn't null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getNickName method won't return null. If null is returned, it implies that the method is generating NullPointer exceptions, which could lead to app crashes.

Scenario 3: Check Nickname Type
Details:
  TestName: testNicknameType.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getNickName method returns a String type.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangements are needed since getNickName requires no inputs.
  Act: Call getNickName method.
  Assert: Use assertTrue to verify that the return value is an instance of String class.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getNickName method is returning a value of String type. This is important because the method is expected to return a nickname in String format. 

Scenario 4: Check for Empty Nickname
Details:
  TestName: testEmptyNickname.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getNickName method returns an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the nickname to an empty string.
  Act: Call getNickName method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getNickName method returns an empty string when the nickname is not set. This is significant as it checks error handling when no proper nickname is set.
