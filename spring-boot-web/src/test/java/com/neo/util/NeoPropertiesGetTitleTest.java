================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Data transmitted through query strings are exposed to unauthorized access because GET requests include query string data in HTTP request headers. Hence, sensitive information should not be placed in query strings.
Solution: Use POST methods instead of GET methods if the data you are sending is sensitive or voluminous. Always encrypt sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If any of the inputs are coming from an untrusted source and the application is not doing the proper validation then it is prone to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Always use parameterized queries or prepare statements for SQL queries. Always validate and sanitize user inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If any of the inputs are rendering on UI and coming from untrusted sources and the application is not properly encoding user input, then it is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting(XSS).
Solution: Always encode user inputs that are rendered on UI. Proper validation and sanitization of user inputs.
