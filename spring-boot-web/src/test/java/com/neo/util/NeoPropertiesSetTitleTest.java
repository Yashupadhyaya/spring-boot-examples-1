================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated user inputs (CWE-20)
Issue: The method setTitle accepts an arbitrary String without performing any form of input validation or sanitization. If the provided string is used in security-critical ways elsewhere in the application, this could lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or Command Injection vulnerabilities. Moreover, it could lead to error conditions if the provided 'title' string doesn't meet the application's expectations (e.g., exceeds a maximum length, contains invalid unicode sequences).
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs. Implement checks to ensure the title meets the application's expectations (e.g., is within an acceptable length, only contains allowable characters). Consider using existing libraries providing such functionality. Make use of Java's String methods like .length(), or use library functions from Apache Commons Lang, OWASP Java Encoder for input sanitization to protect against XSS, etc.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Default Case Test
Details:  
  TestName: defaultCaseScenario.
  Description: This test is meant to check the basic functionality of the setTitle() method to ensure it properly sets the title. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup methods or data are required. 
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with a given text as the parameter.
  Assert: Validate that the 'title' field in the object is equal to the given text.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the setTitle method works as expected. Since the method is a setter, we expect the title field of the object to be equal to the input text. This test is significant to confirm the basic behavior and implementation of the setTitle method.

Scenario 2: Blank Text Test
Details:  
  TestName: checkBlankTextScenario.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setTitle() method when an empty string is provided as an input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup methods or data are required. 
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with an empty string as the parameter.
  Assert: Validate that the 'title' field in the object is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks the behavior of the setTitle method when no title is provided. The expected result is a blank title since that is what was provided. This test is crucial to ensure the method properly handles edge cases like a blank title.

Scenario 3: Null Text Test
Details:  
  TestName: checkNullTextScenario.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setTitle() method when a null value is provided as an input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup methods or data are required. 
  Act: Invoke the setTitle method with a null value as the parameter.
  Assert: Validate that the 'title' field in the object is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks the behavior of the setTitle method when null is provided as the input. The expected result is a null title since that is what was provided. This test is important to ensure the method handles null input gracefully without causing exceptions or crashes.
